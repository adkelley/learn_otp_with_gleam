# Learn OTP w/Gleam

Hello! I'm Ben, a software engineer who's fond of the [Gleam programming language](https://gleam.run/) interested in learning OTP. Gleam is statically typed, has great tooling, and an even better community.

Gleam has a package for using the OTP framework, called `gleam_otp`. It also has a package for more fundamental
Erlang specific concepts, `gleam_erlang`.

I want to use these to build bad ass fault tolerant concurrent software!! But first, I need to learn OTP,
which means I'll be learning with resources written in Erlang (one could also choose Elixir, but I'm #notlikeotherdevs).

While I go on this journey, I'm going to do my damndest to translate the things I learn to Gleam, and record
them here, so that in the future this repo might serve as the base for learning OTP with Gleam.
